Our solution helps users plan their grocery shopping and collaborate with groups in order to not overpurchase food items. Throughout the whole project we completed research, design and development as a team. Research methods like semi-structured interviews, surveys, personas, scenario were used. When designing we utilized sketching, wireframes, lo-fi and hi-fi prototyping.The final product is a functional live progressive web app (PWA) with the option to share shopping list and inventory management with several groups."

Considering this, we prioritized certain functionality in order to shorten the development process for more time dedicated to testing. A clear improvement would be to include an the inventory management functionality that was planned, including, but not limited to; Item categories with sorting functionality, live counter for how long an item has existed in the fridge, push updates if an item is nearing expected expiration date and removal of redundant features like the checkbox in inventory and delete button in shopping list. Another improvement could be in the commenting of the code."

The aims of the project is to create a full usable website for taking care of your plants and we achieve this by allowing those with access to water and fertilize plants, as well as change any relevant information (such as where the plant is placed) to make sure the plants live long lives. We worked together as a team for 2 months to plan, design and code this website so it would fulfill the requirements set by our product owner.             Through several meetings with the product owner and user testing sessions we improved our site to achieve the best user experience possible."
